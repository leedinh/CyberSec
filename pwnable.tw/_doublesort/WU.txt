OVERVIEW: program read in name and number of element of int array then input elements -> sort
	  There is a canary

BUG: use read() to read name -> leakable
     no upperbound for number element -> buffer overflow int_array

EXPLOIT: use read() to leak libc on stack
	*Canary bypass: use scanf(%u) to read elements if  we can input special character that won't change the value at canary ('+' or '-') 
	The array will accending sort so inputs should increasing order to make no change on the payload, then use ret2libc techni [sys+bin_sh]
	Fortunately, canary< sys< bin_sh
Payload layout:
int_arr[35]: ['1'*24] + ['+'] + [sys*8] + [bin_sh*2] (this is 32-bit elf so use x86 calling convention (sys+ retofsys + bin_sh))
